# The idea here is that we can "run the build" multiple times.
# When we do, the build receives an -Dmock.qb.iteration argument which is 1, 2, 3 ...
# We iterate over the build; lib declares an explicit dependency
# depends says that on a particular iteration (default 1), report that you need an additional dependency. 

# need --no-defaults to ignore ~/.qbinit, etc.

# include "mockJar", "depends", and maybe "lib"

mockJar A
  depends C  # reports that it will depend on C during build
mockJar B
  depends C 2 # reports that it will depend on C when run the second time
mockJar C
  depends A 3 # third time through, it reports a cycle
mockJar D
  lib B # openly declares it depends on B
  depends A 2 # will declare it depends on A the second time through
